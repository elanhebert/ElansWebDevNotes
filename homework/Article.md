# Article Response 
The article helped me to better understand the process and the importance of wireframing and other forms of ux planning, especially when working for a large audience. The article introduces different forms of problem solving, most that stress engagement with a wide range of sources when looking for an answer. The author suggests creating a theoretical framework based on varying forms of data, then committing that framework to paper through sketches or virtual software. Planning is so important as it not only produces a better product but prevents further work in the future. The advice from the article reminded me of the most recent in class assignment, both of which stress the importance of planning.
