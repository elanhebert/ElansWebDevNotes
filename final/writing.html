        <h4>
            Capitalist Realism 

          </h4>

<p>
            To low to find my way 
            To high to wonder why 
</p>
            <p>
            The lyrics of the 1998 song Lebanese Blonde by Thievery Corporation reference the feeling of being so low that one is unable to feel fully themselfs, wandering through life unable to create a stable attachment,  remaining unconscious, floating. While the electronic group wrote the song with addiction in mind, the sentiment of their words can be applied to the concepts of both Cruel Optimism and Capitalist realism. When stuck in structures of capitalism (never ending work, loss of milestones, normalcy of monotony) the conscious mind is encouraged to 
            become blind to the nature of one's own existence, or rather the cause of one’s discomfort. You can realize you are dissatisfied but as a result of the conditions which are leaving you unhappy in the first place, you are unable to find a way to change. Here the phrase “too high” becomes synonymous with the notion of the mindset capitalism invokes, or capitalist realism. The state that these conditions create are murky and muddled, time seems to slip away until one finds themself stuck in a way of life they never intended, wanted, or perhaps even sought simply because they felt there was no other option. Often a desire to escape this mindset is present, but one is unable to as a result of this ‘high’ state. This is where Cruel Optimism becomes relevant. One is aware yet simultaneously numbed out. There exists a paradox in which the discomfort under the systems in capitalism largely comes out of this awareness. You are aware that you are unhappy but you are unhappy because you are aware. Change is impossible and yet you still strive for it. This is where the cruel part of Cruel Optimism emerges, as one is often unable to pinpoint the source of said sadness. They are blind to the fact that it is capitalism that is the root of their unhappiness both because they simply do not have time or energy to ponder and there is no other option presented by society (capitalist realism). It is in many ways unfair to expect those suffering under systematic economic disadvantages to ‘wake up’ to the stem of their problems, however could this awareness change anything? One could argue that awareness/consciousness gives individuals control, it gives them the option to choose how to go about feeling and perceiving their difficulties, at least releasing them from the capitalist  ‘high’. However it does not solve the underlying problem, it does not break cycles of poverty or corruption or any of the countless issues that plague american capitalist society. The state or rather concept of addiction and altered states seem representative of those induced by capitalism. As the song states one is low and lost, stuck yet too high to either care, or facilitate the means to escape their suffering (if there truly is a way to ‘escape’). The song ends with the lines:
            A half a million thoughts 
            Are flowing through my mind                                                                                         While most likely referencing an elated state, the lyrics seem to fit in perfectly with the confusion brought upon by diving into the nature of existence under capitalism. While now aware of the existence of these cycles and misters, said awareness in no way prevents the flow of contradicting ideas and perceptions. One is often left with more questions the further along one studies such concepts, as there seems to truly be no single answer to how to solve such issues in any tangible way. </p>

        <h4>Ketamine and Kick Drums</h4>
      <p>
How the horse tranquilizer is molding the underground nyc techno scene and how it calls back to the tweaker invasion of the late 1990s.

I entered through the dingy basement side door of a mutual friend's Bed-Stuy apartment to be greeted by distorted bass kicks, industrial snares, and the oh-so-familiar scent of a sweaty thrashing dance floor. 

Berlin-style techno has been tightening its grasp on the Brooklyn music scene for nearly a decade now, with the opening of popular clubs like the Berghain-inspired Basement and Bossa Nova, it continues to become more and more accessible, assuredly trickling down into the minds and hearts of local college DJs.


This isn’t the first time New York has experienced a techno revolution, some may even say it never really left, however this time around it is directly influenced by Berlin culture, with the music’s Detroit roots never failing to peek through the cracks. Berlin-style techno is hard, it’s industrial, jilted and jaded yet perfectly in step. The music came out of a necessity for substance, it fills the empty and dark spaces of a post-WWII Berlin, inspiring those to dance through the decay. 

As I made my way up to the DJ booth, not even five minutes past my arrival, the question “Do you have any K?” was already thrown at my feet by a complete stranger. Ketamine has been the party drug of choice in the underground scene for a few years now, with its use and popularity going back to the original rave scene of the 90s. The tranquilizer has a lucid dream-like effect, altering one’s perception of movement and sound, numbing the mind and confounding the physical senses. The drug has become somewhat of a joke online in relation to the Brooklyn scene, specifically with the social media of local clubs being plastered with memes about the relationship between DJs, dancers, and the horse tranquilizer. 

Drugs will always be littered about music scenes, but what makes K so influential right now in a post-Covid New York is its specific impact on the individual's relationship between music, perception, and community. The drug is described as making music both sound and feel better, making it no surprise that it's the go-to choice for Techno enjoyers. The drug is undeniably culturally linked to both alternative/underground subcultures and queer communities, and in a time where little substance seems to bind subcultures together, K serves as a glue. There is comradery in its usage and euphoria as its outcome, but how does this impact the music? Well when one’s audience is bound for a K-hole, to say the dancefloor suffers is an understatement. Ketamine may make the music sound better to an individual but often it makes them a clearly worse audience member, more likely to be on the floor than on top of it. As one of my DJ friends recently observed, “If you wanna do a bunch of Ketamine while raving, find a fucking place to sit”. 

This disconnect has led to Techno in smaller NYC scenes evolving and warping, to meet the needs of audiences. The kicks become more distorted, reverbed, and dare I say clipping, the underpinning of the songs switched for recognizable Gen Z audios, with the ultimate precision of the sound dulled to mirror the state of listeners' senses. While there is still an assured passion behind the music, the influence of the substance is hard to make out as positive. Yet as Berlin Techno continues to make its home in NYC, without the deep-rooted cultural community to support the music, listeners will create new ways to bind each other together, whether through their love of Techno or of K.

        <h4>A Suspicion of Morals: On Niezsche's Genealogy of Morality</h4>

        <p>
          
          Morals, like all human creations, are subject to change. This has been proven again and again through the records of history, as countless cultural moral structures have risen to power only to be replaced by newer ‘superior’ understandings. These changes and shifts of morals create their own history, a threadline for which morals can be examined and the circumstances which created them understood. Nietzsche in his work On the Genealogy of Morality argues in favor of the relativity of moral standards, and provides a critique for the populous acceptance of standardized Christian morality. Within these critiques he details the inception of the concepts of good, bad, and evil in relation to the dynamic between the strong and the weak. Through the exploration of morals in relation to human power structures Nietzsche’s work can be interpreted as a prime argument for the utilization of critical thought, expressed through the suspicion of status quo values and social practices. 
            According to Nietzsche, morals originally emerged as a means for the ‘good’ (ruling class) in society to create a separation between themselves and the common people. This original separation had little to do with the usefulness or egotistical nature of good or bad actions, but served as a means to develop an ethos by which the separation of peoples was conceptually furthered (Nietzsche 176-177). From these origins however, emerged varying moral structures which placed different connotations onto the ideas of good and bad, the two most notable being ‘master’ and ‘slave’ morality. Priests, in order to rival the physical power of the rulers or masters of society, utilized slave morality as a tactic in which they could gain the favor and power of the majority (the slaves) in order to pursue an individual path towards power. They weaponized the incompetence of the weak, urging them to believe that their submission was a chosen manifestation of their freedom. This in turn allowed for the demonization of the powerful, who were condemned for acting by their nature and rising above the majority. Thus modern western morality emerged out of human power dynamics, and the constant struggle between weak and strong, and according to Nietzche, out of the specific rise of Christianity. 
           The Christian moral framework solidified in the minds of the majority, the notion that actions serve as a choice of freedom, and not as a result of innate nature. This encourages the suppression of one’s ‘undesirable’ impulses in favor of more mild tendencies which do not inflict physical harm onto one’s fellow man. These shifts go against not only the instincts of the strong, but of all humanity, as the cruel, aggressive, and innate nature of mankind is left with no means of expression. These impulses, seeking catharsis, shift inwards inflicting themselves upon the individual. Nietzsche calls this process the internalization of man, and credits it as the worst illness of mankind (Nietzsche 205). While this ‘illness’ or bad conscience emerges from the suppression of one’s impulses, it seems as if regardless of expression or repression human suffering is always guaranteed. Whether it be inflicted by the individual onto himself, or made manifest by the expression of man’s strength unto his fellow man, there is no escape from suffering. While Nietzsche’s On the Genealogy of Morality explores the rise of the connotations impressed upon the concepts of good and bad, it itself impresses these notions onto the structure of human power with no mercy to the naturally disadvantaged. The weak are continuously and ruthlessly condemned for clinging to moral structure as a path towards self preservation, however it seems like an unfair critique. The weak cannot be blamed for their natural instinct of self preservation any more than the strong can be blamed for theirs. Additionally the capacity of the weak majority to inflict their moral structure onto the strong seems in itself to call for a reevaluation of the very concepts of weak and strong themselves.
           The later relationship outlined by Nietzsche between creditor and debtor, does not receive the same connotations as the dynamic between weak and strong, despite being another formation of human power dynamics bringing about suffering. While feelings of guilt emerge from indebtedness from man to man, through society they become projected existentially as a means for humanity to validate their own repression induced self loathing. The critical thought and questions towards the status quo, which Nietzsche encourages for the previous dynamic, when applied here may serve to ease the internal suffering of man, if only marginally. The two virtues of suspicion and curiosity thus seem like viable paths towards a better functioning society. Suspicion of authority, whether divine or mortal, when paired with earnest curiosity provide a balance between stoic analysis and motivated involvement. One is able to question the organizations of society which result in their present suffering (as Nietzsche does with morals) while maintaining a desire to continue to learn more, to outreach towards appeasement, and to maintain a capacity for hope. In this case, it seems as if suspicion and curiosity directly applied to firm beliefs in indebtedness towards a deity (and in turn of the moral structures impressed by the belief in such a deity) may serve to eliminate an aspect of man’s self loathing. If one through constant curious analysis can rid themselves of unnecessary guilt, of futile feelings of bad conscience, then man will find themself one step further from assured suffering (even if only slightly).
          Nietzsche, throughout On the Genealogy of Morality demands a level of critical evaluation through his exploration of the present moral system. He urges one to follow his threadline, and to understand that morals in originality were not what they came to be in modernity, and may not be serving humanity in the way they seem, or in a positive way at all. Regardless of his personal opinions of the morals themselves, this evaluation of the expressions and consequences of societal standards is utterly important to the lessening of suffering. One must be in a consistent state of evaluation, of suspicion and curiosity, in order to break down their own inhibitions to fulfillment, and to find ways to make meaning outside of the structures of morality, religion, and society.

        <h4>A Repression of Female Sexuality </h4>

        <p>
          
          Victorian morals in regards to sexuality spared no expense in their condemnation of women. From this time period emerged the binary of the virgin and the whore, in which women were utterly defined by their perceived sexual status. Thomas Hardy in his novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles, explores themes of sexuality, morality, and tragedy through both expressions of the subconscious and allusion filled descriptions of the natural world. Hardy in the work provides a critique of Victorian moral standards, but one that ultimately fails to be truly progressive or feminist, as he reverts to the consistent objectification and sexualization of his protagonist Tess through his unreconciled construction of her character depiction as both pure and sexual. 
          Hardy explores themes of sexuality through sensual depictions of the natural world, placing Tess into the role of navigator, maneuvering through the depicted sexual landscapes. As Tess begins fostering feelings for the Reverend’s son Angel, the fertile backdrop of the dairy farm serves as a new start for Tess, where, away from the social scrutiny she faced in her hometown, she is given the opportunity and validity to explore her feelings. One afternoon, after being enchanted by the sounds of Angel’s harp, Tess finds herself following the music through an overgrown garden. The natural depiction is infused with with sexual language, indicative of both the blooming feelings between the pair, and a subtle critique of stringent Victorian morals, “She went stealthily as a cat through this profusion of growth, gathering cuckoo-spittle on her skirts, cracking snails that were underfoot, staining her hands with thistle-milk and slug-slime, and rubbing off upon her naked arms sticky blights which, though snow-white on the apple-tree trunks, made madder stains on her skin;” (101). Hardy’s language is both vivid and evocative, filled with referential visuals and lush alliteration. The scene of Tess walking through the dense foliage is made into an overtly sexual scene, one that places Tess as the navigator as opposed to instigator of her own sexuality. The setting, while sexual, does not impress onto Tess a sense of ownership over the explored sexuality, almost keeping her in the dark from her own relationship to sex. The sticky blights, slug slime, and cuckoo-spittle that cling to Tess and her “naked” arms are all reminiscent of varying bodily fluids, and as she makes her way closer to Angel they stain her skin, perhaps alluding to Tess’s position as a woman already ‘stained’ by sexual experience. The relationship Hardy creates between nature and sex offers a confirmation of sex as both an organic and natural phenomenon, one that should invoke excitement as opposed to shame. This rivaled common Victorian sexual standards of the time, shocking some audiences and leading to heavy censorship of the novel. This decision from Hardy displays a critique of what he viewed as the “prudish” standards of the time, with him taking a stance that not only was sexuality normal and something to be highlighted, but also a sort of validating of female sexuality as a whole. This exploration of female sexuality would seem to provide a level of feminist sentiments to the work; however while Hardy champions sexuality as organic, he at the same time falls back into misogynistic understandings and depictions of femininity. Hardy denies Tess a level of sexual autonomy by keeping her sexual feelings subconscious and somewhat repressed. He validates their existence but puts them intentionally into the backdrop, a level removed from Tess herself. This allows for the continued objectification of Tess as an unbearably beautifully pure woman, an object for the male gaze. She is sexual but unaware, tempting yet innocent, her desirability continually linked to her naivete. 
          After completing her journey through the garden, Tess is flustered by Angel’s acknowledgement of her presence as he engages her —  musing about life and asking her “how is it you do” to which Tess replies, “The trees have inquisitive eyes, haven’t they?” (102). The phrase, while a misunderstanding on the part of Tess, seems to confirm the natural world as a space in which repressed desires are drawn to the front of mind. Tess’s subconscious sexuality is exposed by nature, evoking the feelings which she is keeping locked under layers of shame induced repression. This again displays a decision from Hardy to keep Tess in an infantilized state in regards to her own sexuality. She has no autonomy over her own desires, being subject to the whim of the men around her and feeling naked or exposed when confronted with expressions of her own feelings. She is a ‘pure’ woman in a sexual landscape, not in possession of her sexuality but rather a victim to the animalistic desires that accompany humanity. The ‘inquisitive’ eyes of nature are able to see what she is not, and so is the reader, creating a voyeuristic relationship, one in which the reader is continually confronted with knowing more about Tess’s own sexuality and sexual desires than she is. Soon after this garden encounter, Tess comes to acknowledge her love for Angel, in part due to initial competition for his affections from the other milk maids, and his eventual and clear preference for Tess. While she is able to acknowledge this love, the consistent emphasis on the sexual setting of the nature-filled dairy farm allows for Tess to foster these feelings while maintaining a 'blamelessness’ for her desires. She in this instance is again placed into the trope of an innocent temptress, having sexual feelings and desires but not fully understanding them or her direct relationship to them. Her feelings are continuously coined as love, in this case a euphemism for sexual feelings, which maintain Tess’s innocent identity. Hardy is acknowledging sex as a facet of life, including women as sexual beings, while still leaning into the notion that female sexuality is only morally acceptable if it is repressed, and fought, making the woman a victim as opposed to a proprietor of her own desires.
            Another natural depiction, now even more overt, reflects the increasing intensity of feelings between Angel and Tess, and again provides a passive sexual backdrop, ”Amid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of the Froom Vale, at a season when the rush of juices could almost be heard below the hiss of fertilization, it was impossible that the most fanciful love should not grow passionate. The ready bosoms existing there were impregnated by their surroundings” (122). Love is in the air, it is the season of the “rush of juices”, a time where it is “impossible” for love not to grow into passion. This excerpt again displays Hardy’s rich language, with explicitly sexual themes expressed through the natural world. This description of the valley seems to directly foreshadow the imminent coming together of Tess and Angel, but also further reinforces Tess’s passive role in their relationship. The line “the ready bosoms existing there were impregnated by their surroundings'' jumps out as a rather uncomfortable, if accidental, reference to Tess’s earlier unconscious assault in the woods, in which she was non-consensually impregnated, being viewed by Alec D’Urberville as a sexual object within his environment “ready” for the taking. This parallel implies a level of predeterminism to the sexual experiences which Tess undergoes, a further alienation of autonomy and choice over her body and sexuality. This predeterminism is found scattered throughout the novel, and most notably in the rape scene itself where the act is described by the narrator as “was to be” (60). A large aspect of the novel is the tragedy of Tess’s story, which hangs on the juxtaposition between her identity as an innocent beautiful girl and a woman who has been morally ruined in the eyes of society by a harsh whim of fate. This predeterminism while emphasizing the narrative function of Tess’s rape as a transformation, dismisses an aspect of blame from her assailant Alec, making it seem as though Tess was “doomed” to be taken advantage of simply because she was too good, too pure, and too beautiful not to be. Tess is also excruciatingly objectified in the scene, being boiled down to merely “beautiful feminine tissue” (59). It is an interesting narrative decision, as it is ultimately Hardy who decides to strip Tess of her humanity in this description, additionally removing the violence and violation of the rape, the only explicit sexual relation in the novel, by leaving out details or overt explanations, simply posing to the reader the tragedy of the situation. Hardy in the scene goes as far as to question the presence of her guardian angel, invoking a level of irony as it is Hardy alone who could choose to fill this role. Her unconscious state is also relevant, as it again allows for Tess to be kept in the dark, as she is forced to experience the unfair consequences of sex, while waking up without a true understanding of what transpired, again maintaining her identity as naively beautiful. 
          Returning to the dairy valley, the sexual feelings expressed between Angel and Tess are again deemed determined, as it is described as “impossible” for feelings not to grow passionate in such a setting, and the following description of Angels’ yearning confirms this sentiment, “And as Clare was oppressed by the outward heats, so was he burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for the soft and silent Tess” (122). Just as Angel is “oppressed” by the heat of summer, so too are his burning feelings for Tess a burden upon him. While similarly to Tess, the passion Angel feels is connected to the subconscious sexual setting and natural animalic urges, he is given a level of ownership over his sexuality that Tess is denied. Angel is allowed to be an agent over his desire, even if his feelings exist as burdensome or unavoidable. He is permitted explicit passion, allowed to explore his sexuality with full consciousness and “fervour”, and given the right of initiation of sexual situations, situations which Tess is only allowed to be within but never originate or own. This is further emphasized by Angel’s eventual rejection of Tess, wherein when they both air out the transgressions of their past, Angel rebukes Tess for revealing her rape, despite the obvious nonconsensual nature of Tess’s situation and the reality of Angel being sexually experienced himself. Angel is unable to grapple with the idea of Tess as anything outside of the idealized virginal image he has created of her, with Tess being deemed damaged and forced to bear the burden of a sexual situation she did not want or create. Tess’s desirability in the novel is constantly linked to her “soft and silent” nature, to her innocence and ignorance. Both Angel and Alec in their pursuits of Tess are borderline obsessive over these qualities, truly wanting to possess her as an object for their pleasure more than anything else. They want her so much more intensely because she does not seem to share their sexual desires, she is made the more beautiful because she is unaware of her beauty, however once it is revealed that she could not only possibly possess the same urges but act on them, the fantasy is ruined. The narrator, more than either Alec or Angel, perpetuates this fantasy of Tess, constantly sexualizing and idealizing her. Lines such as, “Perhaps one reason why she seduces casual attention is that she never courts it.” (76) or, “To a young man with the least fire in him that little upward lift in the middle of her red top lip was distracting, infatuating, maddening.” (127) or even, “her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes” (11) emphasize the obsession that is created around the relationship between Tess’s physical appearance and both her identity as innocent, and her desirability to men both in and outside the novel. Hardy becomes complicit in this depiction of Tess, as he anchors the tragedy of the novel in Tess’s struggle with the consequences of her desirability, which largely stems from her purity. The novel is tragic because it forces Tess to suffer for being both pure and sexual, denied sexual autonomy and simultaneously haunted and presumably killed from the consequences of her being a desirable woman. She is placed into the role of virginal temptress, her character heavily informed by the male gaze, and never spared the societal consequences of being a desired woman. 
          While Hardy is able to create a critique of the Victorian societal standards through the tragedy of Tess, it is a hollow one. His inclusions of female sexuality seem to be more voyeuristic than liberating, with the narration ultimately sexualizing and objectifying Tess no less than the men in the novel itself. While exploring themes of the subconscious and repressed, Hardy indeed seems to limit female sexuality to these spheres, failing to create a reality in which a woman can be both overtly sexual and pure at heart, which ultimately only supports the misogynistic standards he seems to attempt to combat. The ultimate murder of Alec seems to provide a cathartic release, and some formations of justice, until they are dashed by Tess’s tragic ending. The implications of Tess’s hanging construct a world in which in the end women will be punished for being either promiscuous or pure, the virgin or the whore, a tragic message to female readers, and one that leaves no hope for a female existence liberated from the consequences of unquenched male desire.
